Natural Disaster: Earthquake

Definition:
An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves.

Causes:
- Tectonic plate movements
- Volcanic eruptions
- Human activities (e.g., mining, reservoir-induced seismicity)

Effects:
- Ground shaking
- Building and infrastructure collapse
- Landslides
- Tsunamis (if underwater)
- Casualties and injuries
- Economic loss and displacement

Preparedness Tips:
1. Create an emergency kit (water, food, flashlight, first aid).
2. Identify safe spots in each room (under sturdy furniture, against inside walls).
3. Practice “Drop, Cover, and Hold On” drills.
4. Secure heavy items and appliances.
5. Have a communication and evacuation plan.

During an Earthquake:
- Indoors: Drop, cover under sturdy furniture, and hold on.
- Outdoors: Move to an open area away from buildings and power lines.
- In a vehicle: Pull over and stop away from overpasses and bridges.

After an Earthquake:
- Check for injuries and help others.
- Inspect for gas leaks, fires, or structural damage.
- Be prepared for aftershocks.
- Stay informed via radio or alerts.
- Avoid damaged areas unless authorized.

Famous Earthquakes:
- 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami
- 2010 Haiti Earthquake
- 2011 Tōhoku Earthquake and Tsunami (Japan)
- 1906 San Francisco Earthquake

Fun Fact:
The largest recorded earthquake was a magnitude 9.5 in Chile in 1960.

Chatbot Response Templates:
Q: What is an earthquake?
A: An earthquake is the sudden shaking of the Earth's surface caused by a release of energy underground, usually due to shifting tectonic plates.

Q: How can I stay safe during an earthquake?
A: Drop, cover under a sturdy object, and hold on until the shaking stops. Stay indoors if you're inside, and move to open ground if you're outside.

Q: What should I do after an earthquake?
A: Check yourself and others for injuries, watch out for hazards like gas leaks, and be prepared for aftershocks.

Q: Can earthquakes be predicted?
A: No, earthquakes cannot be predicted accurately yet, though scientists can identify risk zones based on geological data.
